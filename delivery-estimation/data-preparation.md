We cleaned the whole data set to remove null values and meaningless data columns. Then added the necessary data columns like delivery_days (difference of date on which order was delivered and date when order was created). Then, took the mean of the delivery_days column pincode wise and removed outliers to make the data more uniform. 
You might wonder why we took the mean and not some other statistical figure? The answer to that question lies in the documentation weâ€™re preparing. Because of the high level of deviation in the dataset, mean proved to be the best measure as compared to median and other statistical measures.
