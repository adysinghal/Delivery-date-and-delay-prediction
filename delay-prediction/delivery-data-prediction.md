Cleaned the dataset and created 115 columns for each status code (status codes sent by Delhivery API). One-hot encoded the data, originally in a list of string format to one-hot encoded data. 

Also created a delay function helper to convert a list of string codes to a list of one-hot encoded data values according to data columns in the model training dataset.

Will update this as documentation is being prepared.
