# Delivery-date-and-delay-prediction
Created two models, a statistical model to predict the delivery date and a machine learning model build on XGBoost classifier to predict the delay in the delivery of a shipment.

The detailed documentation for the project is under preparation.

Since the data is proprietary, all csv files contain only a limited number of data entries, to give the viewer an idea of the data being used.

For the time being, the Delivery date prediction folder contains a sample of the dataset that has been prepared after pre-processing, outlier removal and data cleaning along with the prediction function designed for it.

The Delay estimation folder will contain the python notebook (.ipynb) used for training the model (need to take permission from the company, will be uploaded once granted) and a sample of the dataset used to train the model on.

Will update the README.md along with the preparation of the documentation.
